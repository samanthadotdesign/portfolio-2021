## Mobile UX Overhaul

The most important visual improvement was the overall mobile web reconfiguration. Nearly 70% of users log into Silk Road via Android, but Silk Road was best viewed on desktop. I worked on transforming the entire platform to be mobile-first. The principles for optimizing readability for small screens is best demonstrated through the table overviews.

Some considerations we made were if we should transform table into cards in some flows. I sought answers from our users to the key question: is the primary goal to compare information or the view an entry detail?

Most users used Silk Road to create disbursement requests, which meant they wanted to see entire overviews of their account.

      <p>
        I developed this split view for mobile portrait, which is the most-used
        orientation. Accessibility was at the forefront of the of redesign. We
        aligned all content with two keylines, which resulted in improved
        legibility and avoided eye movement from left to the right of the screen
        when scanning. The content was also commonly anchored by the biggest
        identifier as the first column.

        My aim was to make the UI totally obvious and self-explanatory, by
        keeping individual screens pared down to the essentials, showing only
        one focused thing at a time, and so on. Good product design eliminates
        the need for an instruction manual! (Although we’re still guilty of
        having those.)
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s not merely a matter of having clear or basic-looking interfaces.
        (It’s easy to make a simple UI that doesn’t really do much.) The product
        is valuable when it has simple interfaces backed by deeply considered
        logic that saves saves people time and anxiety dealing with the terrible
        WhatsApp mess that they had just learned to live with.

## Tables are opinionated

One of the biggest pain points for users was how there was too many columns and they had a hard time navigating with the horizontal scroll.

It's like an information hierarchy exercise on overload when you only have a limited number of characters per line, limited number of columns, how do you decide what goes first, how to group the information together that is meaningful?

When the product team is making those decisions for our users, it is opinionated and requires in-depth research.

Having a strong editorial sensibility, and knowing when to split complex concepts into simpler individual parts. This one is more of an art than a science, but we had a strong instinct for editing all the facility details until they can be easily understood in the least number of columns, to accommodate changing size of information across different browser widths.

      <p>
        At a glance, we show a lot of identifiers: facility name, date of
        disbursement, facility limit, ... These are necessary to positively
        identify a facility. Once the user finds the intended facility, the user
        can find the side panel for users to see all details.

        Hoverable and clickable table may seem like an established pattern to
        most designers, or other frequent users of software, however, we found
        that our users disliked hidden information. We had to make this
        interaction much more obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
        We developed tooltip interaction for showing more information.
        Interactivity was essential here to provide instant feedback that the

## Design + Engineering

Whatever gets designed for the web app needs to be transformed into code. Even though I’m a big advocate for Figma, our content will not appear there. It’s a very good approximation of what the web app should look like, but it will be displayed as part of a website in a web browser. Multiple web browsers actually.

I do my best to work with developers to implement designs that mimic real life as much as possible.

</PostLayout>

<div className="container-fluid margin-top-36">

  <p className="lesson-header">Designing around worst-case scenarios</p>
    <div className="col-md-6 pe-md-3">
      <p>
        One of our users’ bottlenecks was when there was unreliable connectivity, it results in a poor experience in the browser and any content took a long time to load the data. I worked with our Engineers to keep the web app lightweight to help to increase the mobile performance of our website. The most interesting I learned were the tradeoffs of different ways to render user-specific data.
      </p>

    </div>
    <div className="col-md-6 ps-md-3">
      <p>
        Server-side rendering pre-populates a page with custom content. However,
        it would make too frequent server requests and the pages will have
        higher TTFB (time to first byte) latency and a slower
        time-to-interactive. Our users will see the content sooner, but if they
        click on something, nothing will happen. Although the initial load takes
        more time, there is a lot of dynamic data and clinet-side rendering gets
        users 90% of the way there.
      </p>
    </div>

      <p>
        Pre-rendering with proxy is a tradeoff between client-side and
        server-side rendering. Every pre-rendered page displays a skeleton
        template while the data waits to be rehydrated with AJAX/XHR requests.
        Once the page is fetched, internal routing is done dynamically to take
        advantage of a client-side rendered website.
      </p>
      <p>
        The catch is, because this isn’t SSR, we don’t have user-specific data
        to show at this point—it’s just a static (and somewhat generic) file
        sent directly on the first request, as-is. Here is where we were able to
        integrate skeleton to show the user their data is coming, to increase
        perception of fast load time.

        Because style names can be viewed in the code panel, which is accessible
        inside of any file for both Editors and Viewers, in many cases, it
        becomes possible to implement variables instead of those non-scalable,
        hand-coded values.

        The engineer can "go to master component” to see how the component is
        built, description, usage instructions, variants, and states that exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along with components, taking the time to assign relevant names to
        color, type, and effect styles, such token or variable names, makes it
        easy for the engineers to better match what's in Figma with what's in
        code. A drop shadow named $modal-shadow or color named $alert-warning
        makes it clear which style to use where.

Last but not least, I’m grateful for our user-centric engineers that ask clarifying questions throughout files and flag any potential issues early instead of at the time of implementation. The entire process of going from concept to implementation is more seamless.
