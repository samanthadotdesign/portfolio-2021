    Road to get financing against the invoices to their customers (receivables)
    or invoices from their creditors (payables).

## Mobile UX Overhaul

The most important visual improvement was the overall mobile web reconfiguration. Nearly 70% of users log into Silk Road via Android, but Silk Road was best viewed on desktop. I worked on transforming the entire platform to be mobile-first. The principles for optimizing readability for small screens is best demonstrated through the table overviews.

Some considerations we made were if we should transform table into cards in some flows. I sought answers from our users to the key question: is the primary goal to compare information or the view an entry detail?

Most users used Silk Road to create disbursement requests, which meant they wanted to see entire overviews of their account.

      <p>
        I developed this split view for mobile portrait, which is the most-used
        orientation. Accessibility was at the forefront of the of redesign. We
        aligned all content with two keylines, which resulted in improved
        legibility and avoided eye movement from left to the right of the screen
        when scanning. The content was also commonly anchored by the biggest
        identifier as the first column.

        My aim was to make the UI totally obvious and self-explanatory, by
        keeping individual screens pared down to the essentials, showing only
        one focused thing at a time, and so on. Good product design eliminates
        the need for an instruction manual! (Although we’re still guilty of
        having those.)
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s not merely a matter of having clear or basic-looking interfaces.
        (It’s easy to make a simple UI that doesn’t really do much.) The product
        is valuable when it has simple interfaces backed by deeply considered
        logic that saves saves people time and anxiety dealing with the terrible
        WhatsApp mess that they had just learned to live with.

## Tables are opinionated

One of the biggest pain points for users was how there was too many columns and they had a hard time navigating with the horizontal scroll.

It's like an information hierarchy exercise on overload when you only have a limited number of characters per line, limited number of columns, how do you decide what goes first, how to group the information together that is meaningful?

When the product team is making those decisions for our users, it is opinionated and requires in-depth research.

Having a strong editorial sensibility, and knowing when to split complex concepts into simpler individual parts. This one is more of an art than a science, but we had a strong instinct for editing all the facility details until they can be easily understood in the least number of columns, to accommodate changing size of information across different browser widths.

      <p className="lesson-header">Giving users control for information</p>
      <p>
        At a glance, we show a lot of identifiers: facility name, date of
        disbursement, facility limit, ... These are necessary to positively
        identify a facility. Once the user finds the intended facility, the user
        can find the side panel for users to see all details.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hoverable and clickable table may seem like an established pattern to
        most designers, or other frequent users of software, however, we found
        that our users disliked hidden information. We had to make this
        interaction much more obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
        We developed tooltip interaction for showing more information.
        Interactivity was essential here to provide instant feedback that the
        user can take actions on the rows.
