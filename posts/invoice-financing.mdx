  <p className="lesson-header">The Product</p>
  <p>
    At Funding Societies, our customers use our invoice financing platform, Silk
    Road to get <b>financing against the invoices</b> to their customers
    (receivables) or invoices from their creditors (payables).
  </p>
</div>

<div className="col-md-4 px-md-4">
  <p className="lesson-header">The Problem</p>
  <p>
    Users in Indonesia typically choose to do important tasks entirely on mobile
    devices while running their business. 90% of our users would use Silk Road
    on mobile. However, the web app was <b>not mobile-optimized</b>.
  </p>
</div>

<div className="col-md-4 ps-md-4">
  <p className="lesson-header">The Solution</p>
  <p>
    I initiated a project to <b>overhaul the mobile experience</b>. I advocated
    for these improvements to be included into the product roadmap and won
    buy-in from multiple stakeholders. The hypothesis was that we would drive
    higher conversion and reduce errors by optimizing the mobile experience.

## Business Goals

<p className="lesson-header"></p>

- Invoice financing is one of our most profitable products. Invoices are easily measurable as collateral and our default rates have been consistently low.
- Silk Road is the gateway for customers to request a drawdown from their approved facility (an total loan amount that has not yet been disbursed).
- Optimizing Silk Road for mobile would help 90% of users in Indonesia request access to financing more easily, which would increase our loan origination volume.

        <li>
          <b>Process</b>
          <br/>
          As the Silk Road web app was desktop-first, I opted to take a responsive design approach. I worked with developers to shrink, refactor, rearrange and remove existing elements on desktop to fit the mobile screen.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Information density</b>
          <br />
          Many pages on Silk Road showed multiple tables, where each entry had additional details. Information density was very high and elements were tightly packed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Product analytics</b>
          <br />
          There were no "before" metrics. It was the first time the team had a product design-led initiative as part of the quarterly priorities. Mixpanel and Fullstory were nt set up to measure user experience metrics.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Interaction patterns</b>
          <br />
          I found many shortcomings in similar mobile web apps. It wasn't user-friendly to view multiple tables with pagination or complete long tasks with multiple document uploads under such space limitations.

      Since our customers constantly juggle multiple facilities, loans or

      an overview of all loans outstanding and upcoming repayments.

    <p>
      Our customers use Silk Road to apply for short-term financing to improve
      their cash flow.Our customers are initially approved for a credit facility
      based on their credit quality and request for disbursements of funds by
      uploading their invoices.

      I began by creating a shared document with internal

    <p>All loans are reviewed by two separate internal teams: sales and credit. They both contribute and review information used in the invoice financing product.

       One additional consideration is that <b>mobile users sometimes require different content than desktop users</b>. I planned for these new situations and environments by including different user scenarios.This helped the team discuss how to prioritize content based on the user's goals on the page.

        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Loans</b>
          <br /> Customers can draw down from their facility limit with their invoices
          and track these approved, ongoing loans.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Repayments</b>
          <br /> Customers can track outstanding repayments for their multiple loans.

      <p>
        Large tables was a common feature to present information associated with multiple loans. In order to maintain usability by limiting the size of tables on desktop and mobile, we had to make decisions on which elements were most important to present.
      </p>
      <p>
        I created a draft in Google Sheets and could instantly reflect different changes suggested by the business teams.

          Real data helped stakeholders visualize the user experience and edit elements to achieve a <b>well-considered flow</b> from left to right.
        </li>
        <li>
          Given business constraints, I created a framework on how to <b>limit the number of characters per column</b> and accommodate changing text length across different browser widths.
        </li>
        <li>
          As an early point of research, I observed my <b>pain points</b> while interacting with Google Sheets with real data on mobile for inspiration.

         I developed this split view with the <b>sticky first column</b>.  The table was anchored by the first column so the users have context as they compared different entries and scrolled to read the rest of the data.

          Accessibility was at the forefront of the redesign. The two keylines <b>improved legibility</b> and avoided eye movement from left to the right of the screen when scanning.

      <ul>
        <li>
          Instead of tabs, the best way to present different tables was to simply <b>stack them vertically</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Having tables stacked vertically was the most seamless way to present information to the users without requiring a page refresh. This is especially important in Indonesia where users may have <b>slow connections</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Determining the right level of information density in the tables was difficult. We got feedback from users about the <b>overuse of whitespace</b> in their other products. 
        </li>
        <li>
          The <b>sweet spot</b> was to determine how much whitespace to leave between the elements so the display doesn't appear cramped but also accommodate users’ preference for a more tightly-packed layouts.

        I worked with our Engineers to keep the web app lightweight to help to
        increase the mobile performance of our website. The most interesting
        thing I learned was the tradeoffs of different ways to render
        user-specific data.

        I worked with fluid grids and media queries to allow the layout, image

## Impact in Digits

With the help of my Product Manager, we created a system of measurement.

Now, we’re tracking completion rate for key tasks using Mixpanel, observing user behaviour using Fullstory recordings, and measuring platform experience through strategically located in-app surveys.

We consistently found a **94-95% completion rate** for drawdown financing applications in Indonesia, which helped to **reduce our churn rate by 33%**.

        If we could conduct another discovery study, I would suggest to test
        users' understanding of terms, concepts, and groupings. The insights

        Since mobile has been so important, I'm used to designing for both
        mobile and desktop at the same time. It was a unique experience for me
        to translate a desktop-only web app to smaller device breakpoints.
