<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<div className="col-md-4 pe-md-4">
  <p className="lesson-header">The Product</p>
  <p>
    At Funding Societies, our customers use our invoice financing platform, Silk
    Road to get financing against the invoices to their customers (receivables)
    or invoices from their creditors (payables).
  </p>
</div>

<div className="col-md-4 px-md-4">
  <p className="lesson-header">The Problem</p>
  <p>
    Nearly 90% of our users in Indonesia use Silk Road on their mobile. They
    choose to do their key, important tasks entirely on their mobile device.
    However, Silk Road was <b>not mobile-optimized</b>.
  </p>
</div>

<div className="col-md-4 ps-md-4">
  <p className="lesson-header">The Solution</p>
  <p>
    I initiated this mobile UX overhaul project. I advocated for buy-in from
    stakeholders for these improvements to be included into the product roadmap.
    The hypothesis was that we would drive higher utilization and reduced errors
    by optimizing the mobile experience.

## Business Goals

<p className="lesson-header"></p>

- Invoice financing is one of our most profitable products. The collateral against an invoice is very clear and our default rates have been consistently very low.
- Silk Road is the gateway for customers to communicate to Funding Societies to request a drawdown from their facility (an approved total loan amount that has not yet been disbursed).
- Optimizing the Silk Road for mobile would help 90% of users in Indonesia request access to financing more easily, which increases our loan origination volume.

## Validating Solutions

Whatever gets designed for the web app needs to be transformed into code. Even though I’m a big advocate for Figma, our content will not appear there. It’s a very good approximation of what the web app should look like, but it will be displayed as part of a website in a web browser. Multiple web browsers actually.

I do my best to work with developers to implement designs that mimic real life as much as possible.

      <p>
        One of our users’ bottlenecks was when there was unreliable connectivity, it results in a poor experience in the browser and any content took a long time to load the data. I worked with our Engineers to keep the web app lightweight to help to increase the mobile performance of our website. The most interesting I learned were the tradeoffs of different ways to render user-specific data.
      </p>

    </div>
    <div className="col-md-6 ps-md-3">

        Server-side rendering pre-populates a page with custom content. However,
        it would make too frequent server requests and the pages will have
        higher TTFB (time to first byte) latency and a slower
        time-to-interactive. Our users will see the content sooner, but if they
        click on something, nothing will happen. Although the initial load takes
        more time, there is a lot of dynamic data and clinet-side rendering gets
        users 90% of the way there.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pre-rendering with proxy is a tradeoff between client-side and
        server-side rendering. Every pre-rendered page displays a skeleton
        template while the data waits to be rehydrated with AJAX/XHR requests.
        Once the page is fetched, internal routing is done dynamically to take
        advantage of a client-side rendered website.
      </p>
      <p>
        The catch is, because this isn’t SSR, we don’t have user-specific data
        to show at this point—it’s just a static (and somewhat generic) file
        sent directly on the first request, as-is. Here is where we were able to
        integrate skeleton to show the user their data is coming, to increase
        perception of fast load time.

        Because style names can be viewed in the code panel, which is accessible
        inside of any file for both Editors and Viewers, in many cases, it
        becomes possible to implement variables instead of those non-scalable,
        hand-coded values.

        The engineer can "go to master component” to see how the component is
        built, description, usage instructions, variants, and states that exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along with components, taking the time to assign relevant names to
        color, type, and effect styles, such token or variable names, makes it
        easy for the engineers to better match what's in Figma with what's in
        code. A drop shadow named $modal-shadow or color named $alert-warning
        makes it clear which style to use where.

        Our engineers have access to in-progress design files, which is a great
        way to communicate how reusable styles and components in designs are
        being used.

<p className="lesson-header">Checking in early and often</p>

Last but not least, I’m grateful for our user-centric engineers that ask clarifying questions throughout files and flag any potential issues early instead of at the time of implementation. The entire process of going from concept to implementation is more seamless.

        My colleague and I conducted contextual inquiry interviews with 20
        users across different roles to deeply understand the current
        origination and underwriting process. It was especially important to{" "}
        <b>capture nuances of the process</b> that was not evident in the
        written output. 
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the challenges that emerged was that users wanted to see all
        information available at any given time. The existing process had{" "}
        <b>everything available to view</b> at the same time across different
        windows of Slack, Excel, Google Sheets, and Trello.
      </p>
      <p>
        We wanted our users to feel completing each defined task was seamless,
        that they weren’t sacrificing any of the information they were once used
        to.

        There are two types (or levels) of metrics. L1 metrics are related to
        the effectiveness of our Silk Road product fulfilling users’ jobs as it
        is used primarily for drawdown or disbursement request and checking
        repayments and any information related to the utilization.

        L2 metrics are contributing factors that correlate with usability,
        experience and design that help users while using Silk Road. There is
        room to explore in improving L2 metrics, which might contribute to the
        improvement of L1 metrics.
