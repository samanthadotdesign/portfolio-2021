<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<div className="col-md-4 pe-md-4">
  <p className="lesson-header">The Product</p>
  <p>
    At Funding Societies, our customers use our invoice financing platform, Silk
    Road to get financing against the invoices to their customers (receivables)
    or invoices from their creditors (payables).
  </p>
</div>

<div className="col-md-4 px-md-4">
  <p className="lesson-header">The Problem</p>
  <p>
    Nearly 90% of our users in Indonesia use Silk Road on their mobile. They
    choose to do their key, important tasks entirely on their mobile device.
    However, Silk Road was <b>not mobile-optimized</b>.
  </p>
</div>

<div className="col-md-4 ps-md-4">
  <p className="lesson-header">The Solution</p>
  <p>
    I initiated this mobile UX overhaul project. I advocated for buy-in from
    stakeholders for these improvements to be included into the product roadmap.
    The hypothesis was that we would drive higher utilization and reduced errors
    by optimizing the mobile experience.

## Business Goals

<p className="lesson-header"></p>

- Invoice financing is one of our most profitable products. The collateral against an invoice is very clear and our default rates have been consistently very low.
- Silk Road is the gateway for customers to communicate to Funding Societies to request a drawdown from their facility (an approved total loan amount that has not yet been disbursed).
- Optimizing the Silk Road for mobile would help 90% of users in Indonesia request access to financing more easily, which increases our loan origination volume.

      <p className="lesson-header">Mobile was an afterthought</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          I did not have a choice but to take the{" "}
          <b>responsive design approach</b> since Silk Road web app was
          desktop-first. I worked with developers to shrink, refactor,
          rearrange, remove the existing elements on desktop to fit the mobile
          screen.
        </li>
        <li>
          Many pages on Silk Road showed <b>multiple tables</b>, where each
          entry had accompanying details. The information density was very
          tightly packed.
        </li>
        <li>
          There were <b>no "before" metrics</b>. It was the first time the team
          had a product design-led initiative as part of the quarter priorities.
          Mixpanel and Fullstory weren't set up to measure user experience
          metrics.
        </li>
        <li>
          I found many <b>shortcomings in similar mobile web apps</b>. It wasn't
          user-friendly to view multiple tables with pagination or complete long
          tasks with multiple document upload with such space limitations.
        </li>
      </ol>

      The main purpose our customers use Silk Road is to improve their cash flow
      with short-term financing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our customers get their pre-approved facility (it helps to think of it as
      a large credit card limit) and they need to request for disbursements of
      funds by uploading their invoices.

        I began by creating a shared document with all our stakeholders who

        One additional consideration is that{" "}

        . I planned for these new situations and environments by including user scenarios.This
        helped the team discuss how to prioritize content based on the user's goals

        Although we expected horizontal scrolling for tables on mobile, I
        recommended the <b>guideline</b> for the number of table columns should
        not overflow beyond the page width for desktop.
      </p>
      <p>
        I could instantly reflect changes in requirements by using a Google
        Sheets draft.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Real data helped stakeholders imagine the experience and edit to achieve a <b>well-considered flow</b> from left to right.
          </li>
          <li>
            These business constraints gave me a strong instinct about how to <b>limit characters per column</b> and eventually how we could accommodate the changing text length across different browser widths.
          </li>
          <li>
            As a earliest point of research, I observed my <b>pain points</b> while interacting with Google Sheets with real data on mobile for
            inspiration.

          I developed this split view with the <b>sticky first column</b>. The

          Accessibility was at the forefront of the of redesign. The two

          Instead of tabs, the strongest relationship between the different

        If we had more resources, I would have chosen a mobile-first approach
        within the <b>adaptive design framework</b>.

        For example, when users applied for financing, we were limited by the
        constraints of the desktop design and shipped one very long form. We
        weren't able to implement a <b>multi-page flow</b>, which would have
        solved this issue for the loan application experience.

        Multi-page flow would help users focus on the application section,
        reduce errors, and navigate more easily between sections.
