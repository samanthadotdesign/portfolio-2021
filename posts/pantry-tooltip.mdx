# Form Microinteraction

</PostLayout>

<div className="col-md-4 padding-right-24">
  <AccordionContainer title={"Why did I include this?"}>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Our web application for loans is the first customer touchpoint for loan
        application.
      </li>
      <li>
        By reducing the errors in the form application, it would help the sales
        processing be more efficient.
      </li>
      <li>We conducted usability testing for desktop and mobile.</li>
      <li>
        We discussed adding this form field component to our Pantry Design
        System.
      </li>
    </ul>

## What was the problem?

1. The user clicks into the controls, they can create the drum beats, and also add text, change the colors and tempo.
2. The user can record the playing audio visualizer.
3. They currently can share it via a link.
4. It's also mobile responsive.

## How Make It Pop was built?

1. After experimenting using [ToneJS](https://tonejs.github.io/docs/14.7.77/MembraneSynth.html) to create the different sounds, we preferred using prerecorded sounds for the more realistic effect. We injected the p5 sound library via CDN to ensure a faster delivery for the preloaded sounds.
2. Creating a React global store and tweaking P5 canvases allowed us to use **React and P5 together.** We wanted to use React components that passed data into the P5 to keep the app as modular as possible for mobile responsiveness and maintainability.
3. We used [Web API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream_Recording_API) to capture the moving audio visualizer.
4. We intentionally didn't include authentication so the user can immediately interact with the audio visualizer, rather than forcing them to sign up before they could access any of the features.

## What did I learn?

1. Implementing React + p5 together
2. Organizing components that optimized for final UI
3. Global store was very useful especially for making implementing the beats effortless
