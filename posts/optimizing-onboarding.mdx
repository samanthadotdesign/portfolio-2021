    Funding Societies provides financing for small and medium-sized enterprises.
    Customers can apply directly online on our website. They value speed. To
    improve the time it takes for loans to get approved, we automate basic
    checks during onboarding and screening through this Instant Approval
    feature.

  <p className="lesson-header">The Problem</p>
  {/* prettier-ignore */}
  <p>
    30–40% of web application submissions contain errors in critical identification fields. This delays processing time for customers and even results in rejections. To fully leverage our <a href="https://samantha.design/work/loan-origination-system">automated underwriting tool</a>, we need to ensure that users’ data is clean and standardised. We want to make an “instant” promise to customers, but we are playing catch up with customers' expectations.
  </p>

<div className="col-md-4 ps-md-4">
  <p className="lesson-header">The Hypothesis</p>
  <p>
    We use a third-party identity document verification tool,&nbsp;
    <a href="https://onfido.com/">Onfido</a>
    &nbsp;to quickly verify a user’s identity with just their ID and face. Our
    hypothesis is one of the reasons why users submit incorrect information is
    that after they upload their ID, their ID information is parsed into the
    application form fields. Users assume that the parsing is accurate and don’t
    correct it if there are errors.

          After users upload their ID and it appears on the web application that
          some fields are auto-populated,

        </li>
        <li>
          The users found it difficult to notice misspellings inside the form
          fields since the <b>application process is very long</b> and the user
          gets fatigued.

        Tooltip emphasises the consequences for inaccurate information. However,
        since this tooltip is there all the time, it might annoy users. Our
        customers run their own businesses and are professionals so they might
        feel like they are being talked "down" to.

        When tooltip only appears after a short time has passed, it gives enough
        time to the user to realize where the tooltip is coming from. This
        solution is best suited when users don’t know how to fill the form
        field. In our case, users definitely know what ID information is.

        <b>Inline reminder</b>
        <br />
        For critical details that weren't pre-populated by the system, I
        suggested an inline tooltip to draw more attention to them.

        <b>Inline confirmation</b>
        <br />
        For critical details pre-populated by the system, I suggested a tooltip
        where users had to confirm their details to dismiss. 
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
          However, the two fields with tooltips
          appeared on consecutive questions and I wanted to ensure it wasn't
          annoying for users.
          </li>
          <li>
          I was concerned about the potential friction early on. The goal was
          to make this inline confirmation so light, quick, and easy, that the users
          don't feel like it's an additional hassle.
          </li>
          <li>
          Even if the details are parsed correctly, users shouldn't feel
          like it was a big effort to confirm and hopefully conveyed a sense of
          trustworthiness.

              Our participants were not familiar with Figma prototypes so I
              chose to limit the functionality. For example, instead of users
              typing their own name in, the form field would be filled with a
              value.

              The interviewer briefed the participants to imagine a preset
              scenario during a loan application, which already drew attention
              to the field. For example, "Let's say there is a misspelling in

## Final Solution

Almost all the tasks were completed successfully during usability tests but there was room for improvement to make the inline confirmation button look more obvious.

However, our final decision was to **remove the this confirmation altogether** because the team did not want to impose two additional clicks to the users early on in the application process.

I designed and tested another concept where users **confirmed all four critical fields** at the end of the application.

<div className="container-fluid margin-top-36">
  <div className="row d-flex">
    <div className="col-md-3 padding-right-24">
      <p className="lesson-header">Confirmation Modal</p>
      <p>
        <b>Interaction</b>
        <br />
        At the final step of the application, when users clicked "Continue", a
        confirmation modal with the details appeared. If users needed to edit,
        they would click on the Edit button to show the editable fields.
      </p>

        <br />
        <ul>

            5/5 completed the task and said it was clear what they were expected
            to do.
          </li>
          <li className="success">
            4/5 said it was user-friendly to have this section to check details
            before submitting application.
          </li>
          <li className="success">
            1/5 did not expect the modal at all. Based on previous experience,
            they expected to redo the whole application again.

## Key Learnings

**Go with the less imposing version first.**
The team decided to implement the version of inline reminders only and the confirmation modal at the end of the application to reduce the number of clicks the users needed to do.

**How can we size the pain point more accurately?**
The team didn't want to impose additional clicks for the inline confirmation for the 60–70% of users who were already doing it correctly. Although only 30–40% applications had typos, a much higher number of users could be affected because there were users who noticed the incorrect spelling and successfully submitted correct fields.

**We must weigh testing biases proportionally.**
The users would see inline reminders first in the application flow (users fill in company details first, then only upload their ID). Therefore, users would be primed that the tooltips won't be clickable. We tested successfully with ten local colleagues but they were likely more familiar with digital experiences. Inline confirmation is a more unusual interaction pattern and therefore risky, for our audience.

## Impact in Digits

The key metric that the design affects is the **error rate** of identification details in applications.

Reducing the error rate will have subsequent effects on **turnaround time** for the sales team and on returning decisions on loan applications.

The interim projected impact is we would **reduce the error rate via web app by 10%** and speed up turnaround time for new applications by **10–30 minutes per application**.
