    Funding Societies provides financing for small and medium-sized enterprises.
    Customers can apply directly online on our website. They value speed. To
    improve the time it takes for loans to get approved, we automate basic
    checks during onboarding and screening through this Instant Approval
    feature.

  <p className="lesson-header">The Problem</p>
  <p>
    30‚Äì40% of web application submissions contain errors in critical
    identification fields. This delays processing time for customers and even
    results in rejections. To fully leverage our{" "}
    <a href="https://samantha.design/work/loan-origination-system">
      automated underwriting tool
    </a>
    , we need to ensure that users‚Äô data is clean and standardised. We want to make
    an ‚Äúinstant‚Äù promise to customers, but we are playing catch up with customers'
    expectations.
  </p>
</div>

<div className="col-md-4 ps-md-4">
  <p className="lesson-header">The Solution</p>
  <p>
    We use a third-party identity document verification tool,
    <a href="https://onfido.com/"> Onfido</a> to quickly verify a user‚Äôs identity
    with just their ID and face. Our hypothesis is one of the reasons why users submit
    incorrect information is that after they upload their ID, their ID information
    is parsed into the application form fields. Users assume that the parsing is
    accurate and don‚Äôt correct it if there are errors.

        <li>
          After users upload their ID and it appears on the web application that
          some fields are auto-populated, users don‚Äôt expect that they will have
          to edit them.
        </li>
        <li>
          The users found it difficult to notice misspellings inside the form
          fields since the application process is very long and the user gets
          fatigued.

        <br />
        Tooltip emphasises the consequences for inaccurate information. However,
        since this tooltip is there all the time, it might annoy users. Our
        customers run their own businesses and are professionals so they might
        feel like they are being talked "down" to.

        <br />
        When tooltip only appears after a short time has passed, it gives enough
        time to the user to realize where the tooltip is coming from. This
        solution is best suited when users don‚Äôt know how to fill the form
        field. In our case, users definitely know what ID information is.

        section that says "Please ensure full and accurate information. Any
        inaccuracies may affect your application". But, we still have roughly
        30‚Äì40% applications still contain typos.

        For the four critical details: <br />
        <em>Company name</em> and <em>Company registration number</em> are not pre-populated

        <b>Inline reminder</b>

        <b>Inline confirmation</b>
        <br />
        For critical details pre-populated by the system, I suggested a tooltip
        where users had to confirm their details to dismiss. However, the two fields with tooltips
        appeared on consecutive questions and I wanted to ensure it wasn't
        annoying for users.
        <br />I was concerned about the potential friction early on. The goal was
        to make this inline confirmation so light, quick, and easy, that the users
        don't feel like it's an additional hassle.
        <br />Even if the details are parsed correctly, users shouldn't feel
        like it was a big effort to confirm and hopefully conveyed a sense of
        trustworthiness.

              Our participants were not familiar with Figma prototypes so I

              typing their own name in, the form field would be filled with a
              value.
            </li>
            <li>
              The interviewer briefed the participants to imagine a preset
              scenario during a loan application, which already drew attention
              to the field. For example, "Let's say there is a misspelling in

## Iteration

Almost all the tasks were completed successfully during usability tests but there was room for improvement to make the inline confirmation button look more obvious.

However, our final decision was to **remove the this confirmation altogether** because the team did not want to impose two additional clicks to the users early on in the application process.

I designed and tested another concept where users **confirmed all four critical fields** at the end of the application.

## Key Learnings

**Go with the less imposing version first.**
The team decided to implement the version of inline reminders only and the confirmation modal at the end of the application to reduce the number of clicks the users needed to do.

**How can we size the pain point more accurately?**
The team didn't want to impose additional clicks for the inline confirmation for the 60‚Äì70% of users who were already doing it correctly. Although only 30‚Äì40% applications had typos, a much higher number of users could be affected because there were users who noticed the incorrect spelling and successfully submitted correct fields.

**We must weigh testing biases proportionally.**
The users would see inline reminders first in the application flow (users fill in company details first, then only upload their ID). Therefore, users would be primed that the tooltips won't be clickable. We tested successfully with ten local colleagues but they were likely more familiar with digital experiences. Inline confirmation is a more unusual interaction pattern and therefore risky, for our audience.
