    <b>Venepuncture</b> is the process of drawing blood from a vein, to collect
    a blood sample for various diagnostics tests.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Intravenous (IV) therapy</b> involves inserting introducing medications,
    fluids, or other support directly into a patient's bloodstream by inserting
    a catheter into a vein.

    NUHS developed a proof of concept that uses the infrared camera on the
    HoloLens2 itself to detect the veins on a person’s hand. Our goal was to
    productize their <a href="http://">published research</a> to be usable in
    their clinics.

      <p>
        Even though the anatomy and location of the veins might be the same, the
        depth, amount of skin and fat, caliber of the veins, tension and blood
        flow is different. For example, the veins or blood flow direction is not
        visible in children.

        Junior doctors have some training as a medical student, but the clinic
        setting is very different. It is difficult to get practice in because a
        senior doctor will step in in challenging cases, specially in an
        emergency.

        Clinicians experience performance anxiety. If the clinician isn't able
        to get the correct depth on the first attempt, they have to decide
        whether to reattempt or adjust the needle while it is already under the
        skin.

        All I’m thinking about is APO (Acute Pulmonary Oedema) patients. They
        come in all wet, super wet. They either have liver, kidney, or heart
        problems. Fluid doesn’t stay inside the veins, it goes into the tissue
        itself so they become very swollen and their body is trying to release
        the fluids through the skin.
