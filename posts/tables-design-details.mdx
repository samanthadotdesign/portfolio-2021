## Introduction

During my time at Funding Societies, I've had to think about tables a lot. We have consumer-facing invoice financing tools that users use to manage their day-to-day invoices, internal-facing loan origination system where the business operations teams use to underwrite credit, and other use cases in between.

This case study delves into what I've learned about tables, the design details that go into crafting and shipping high-functioning, maintainable, accessible, easy-to-use tables.

One of the most interesting challenges in designing tables is desiging for mobile and scalability.

## Challenges

1. Can we craft a reusable table component that fulfills multiple needs and use cases? Across different products: each product is built differently (Angular) Within the product: each country has their own needs
2. As usual, there is a lot of information needed to be displayed. As our internal enterprise tool and for our customers that run large businesses, they have thousands of entries.
3. There are so many different types of entries needed – input forms, file uploads.
4. Alongside low connectivity issues in Indonesia, 75% of users log in using mobile, which is not optimized for (and didn't exist).

## 1: Tables are opinionated

It's like an information hierarchy exercise on overload when you only have a limited number of characters per line, limited number of columns, how do you decide what goes first, how to group the information together that is meaningful?

When the product team is making those decisions for our users, it is definitely opinionated and requires in-depth research.

Two types of tables: Mailchimp (designed for you, similar to the problem we're having), Google Sheets (self designed tables)

Having a strong editorial sensibility, and knowing when to split complex concepts into simpler individual parts. This one is more of an art than a science, but we have a strong instinct for breaking down problems until they can be easily understood in simple UI flows. Time, space, rhythm, and pace in type.

## 2: Even grayness

Always choosing clarity over being slick or fancy. We aim to make the UI totally obvious and self explanatory, by keeping individual screens pared down to the essentials, showing only one focused thing at a time, and so on. Good product design eliminates the need for an instruction manual!

There’s one other thing that’s important for simple design. It’s not merely a matter of having clear or basic-looking interfaces. (It’s easy to make a simple UI that doesn’t really do much.) The magic combo is having simple interfaces paired with powerful capabilities below the surface. For example, HEY looks simple, and it’s straightforward to use, but it’s backed by some deeply considered ideas, logic,nd machinery that reduces the effort in keeping up with email. The interface itself is simple, but the thinking and the system behind it is complex. The product is valuable because it saves people time and anxiety dealing with the terrible email mess that they had just learned to live with.

## 3: Mobile Design

Prioritizing respectful interfaces that don’t overwhelm or try to nag the user into certain behaviors. We intentionally don’t include things like notification counts/badges, 3-column designs, or other distracting elements unless we absolutely can’t avoid them. We don’t like the idea of having “sticky” interfaces—we want our customers to use our products to get the job done, and then go do something else. That makes the whole design approach more peaceful in general.

Caring about copywriting, and taking the time and space to explain things with words, instead of making minimalist UIs with lots of unlabeled buttons, etc. (Although we’re still guilty of having a few of those.)
