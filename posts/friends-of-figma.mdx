# Friends of Figma

I'm currently building a more connected design community in Asia-Pacific for Figma. I work with Friends of Figma Community Advocates to build their own advocacy groups and consolidate interesting events and content for their audiences.

I love making Figma files where everyone can jump on during an event. It's a fun way for our audience to experience new ways of using Figma and they can duplicate the files to remix in their own ways.

Here are a few ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ

      <LoopingVideo src="/images/work/friends-of-figma/shopback.mp4" />
      <figcaption className="pb-3">
        For a talk about UX research teams, I made a Figjam file of baseball
        cards, where the audience can get to know each other.

      <figcaption>
        Two things which makes this file special are <br />
        (1) Many audience members didn't know they could export Figma components
        and variants into Figjam.
        <br />
        (2) We did a special edition to raise funds for Ukraine.

        For the last Friends of Figma Singapore event of 2021, I made an
        interactive game themed <em>Otters in Singapore</em>.

      <figcaption>
        I used interactive components so
        <br />
        (1) the landscape automatically loops and the otter runs
        <br />
        (2) audience can use keys to make the otter jump and double jump

        When we organized an event about switching careers into UX, I expected
        more beginners to Figma. <br />I made a simple activity to show how
        components and instances worked.

      <figcaption>
        (1) The event happened to fall on Mid Autumn Festival, so my idea was to
        write wishes on lanterns and set them into the sky.
        <br />
        (2) I showed the audience how by only using Smart Animate on the
        instances in frames, we could make the lanterns move at different
        speeds.

        I really enjoy making and hosting interactive segments that facilitate
        people to have fun. <br />
        In this event, our audience created little monsters in one page and then
        were transported to Duxton (one of my favourite places in Singapore) to look
        for their hidden monsters.
