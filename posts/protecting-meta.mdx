<h1>Unifying Meta’s Moderation Tool</h1>

  <p className="lesson-header">Cross-Meta Integrity</p>
  <p>
    Our mission is to ensure trustworthy connections, protecting people and
    businesses by reducing harmful content like violence and scams. We use human
    reviewing, labeling, and machine learning to moderate content.

<div className="col-md-4 px-md-4">
  <p className="subtitle-caption">THE PRODUCT</p>
  <p className="lesson-header">Single Review Tool (SRT)</p>
  <p>
    Our human reviewer platform, SRT, serves 50,000 reviewers who make decisions
    for 2,000+ different types of jobs across both paid and organic content on
    all Meta's platforms.

## Business Goals

<p className="lesson-header">
  Improve human reviewer performance at scale for quality and efficiency
</p>

1. **Precision** — Provide information that helps reviewers catch true-positives for violating content and improve ML model
2. **False discovery rate** — ML model enqueues jobs for human review when there is uncertainty. Hence, reviewers train ML model to predict false-positives more accurately too.
3. **Average handling time** — Streamline information and automate to reduce time taken for human reviewer to process jobs
4. **Response time** — Empower policymakers to self-manage reviewers' workflows to apply policies consistently

      Largest unification initiative for SRT
    </p>

1. SRT UI is massively **complex, fragmented, and inconsistent**, making maintenance and optimization difficult.

2. Even though there are similar use cases across multiple types of review, the parts of the workflow are **not interoperable**.

3. Each problem area has a dedicated Policies team, but not Product Engineering support. There is **tech debt** as a result of rapidly responding to new malicious activity threats.

## High-Level Approach

Without a UXR or PM capacity, I coordinated and collaborated with <b>multiple cross-functional teams</b> that hadn't previously worked closely together before.

## Understand

There were two main objectives for my understanding work:

- To identify opportunities by conducting heuristic evaluation and cognitive walkthroughs with content moderators from various markets
- To define a robust set of heuristics and audit framework that is repeatable across multiple workflows

  <div className="row d-flex">
    <div className="col-md-4 padding-right-24">

      <p>
        I helped the team define the audit framework, created multiple workshops
        to support the initiative, and published a set of heuristics specific to
        content moderation tooling.

## Converge

Since SRT was a tool that was used across multiple workflows, we had to bring designers to represent each workflow for the unifying work. By identifying gaps and similarities between different workflows, we would be able to create a unified product.

I led the sprint by designing the sprint activities and facilitating to bring out the best ideas from all the participants, with one other co-lead.

## Unified Vision

- Component Library

- Roadmap for 2023

## Learnings

I learned how to start working on a unifying a complex product. Large products naturally have a legacy and complexity.

The product served the team well but at a critical point, the container cannot fit its growth and we need to break and build a new vessel.

In this 0 &rarr; 1 work to reimagine the product, I found three critical parts to align on a design vision for the product with a longer time horizon.

- Doing deep research on the product and evaluating the user experience based on a set of heuristics (if there isn't a framework, build one!)
- Building relationships with stakeholders and bringing them into the design process through clear documentation and following up on their biggest concerns
- Presenting to multiple levels of leadership across functions

## Reflections

Unfortunately the entire Cross-Meta Integrity product engineering team in Singapore was unexpectedly laid off in Singapore.

I'm proud of the work that I did at Meta in a short period. I worked quickly to understand the problem space and was hungry to contribute to the team.

My counterpart in Sunnyvale is continuing the work on the **Integrity Component Library**, where the SRT vision sprint was influential. Please contact me for my reference &#9786;
