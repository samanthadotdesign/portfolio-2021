## Denial

_(There are other things I can do)_

September 2017. My boyfriend at the time was a gifted, passionate software engineer. He was the first person to tell me that I wasn't too old or not smart enough to attempt learning software engineering. I wish I could say I became a software engineer after that but I applied what I learned on product design instead.

Design is based on logic and reason and a lot of storytelling — there’s good design and bad design, you could articulate it by understanding some key concepts and it all just made lots of sense.

## Frustration

_(I know it's important but there's so much)_

If you're a participant in technology many use everyday, I don't think one needs a long historical poetic answer to why they're interested in tech. The truth is that I like computers and I like beautiful things and it is apparent to me that everything had software in it.

So if everything in the world is going to have software, then I should try to understand software so that I can understand the world—makes sense, right? Everyone is on their phones, on apps like Facebook all the time, yet, they have no idea what that is in reality.

## Depression

I have a debilitating sadness mixed with a realized fear that I'm not good enough, or will ever be. I always felt intimidated by software development. It is such a massive discipline and I didn't understand much about the technology I lived so much of my life on.

## Experiment

_(I'm scared but at least I have time and patience)_

Fast foward to December 2020, after experiencing almost a full year of COVID restrictions, I knew I wasn't going anywhere in 2021 either. I found Rocket Academy, which was a software engineering bootcamp that just started in Singapore. I liked that the founders were still teaching the course and there were only four others in my batch. My job allowed me to take some time off.

So I learned how to use the Command Line, wrote Javascript, fell in love with React and convenient Python syntaxes, thought out loud as I was doing something, documented my trade offs and learned how to Google clues.

During this process, I wasn’t a designer, or a developer — I was just someone making this thing in a way that others could understand without me around.

## Decision

_(How did I design before I learned to code?)_

I want to share this thing that I found online. This group of people decided to ask this other group of people to draw a bicycle.

We are all very familiar with bicycles, we don’t bat an eye at the sight of one. Some of you probably ride bikes all the time, but we have no idea how they work.

It’s eye opening to see that if you truly don’t understand how something works, how can one expect to be able to draw it… or design it?

And that’s how being a developer makes me a better designer — In order for me to expect me to do a good job at designing something, I should know how it works first, even if I can’t write all of the code (think complex backend magic), I should be able to understand the basics of how it works to do a good job, and I think you should too.

Designing with code has helped me do my research differently, inspiring me to think and build in ways I hadn't known before.

At the end of the day my job isn’t drawing cool bitmaps just like after taking a software engineering bootcamp, my job isn’t writing JavaScript. We are all building things, we are all creating something, and each of us have something to contribute with in different ways.

## Integration

_(Keep fearing but keep trying)_

"Find a passion as big as your fear. Find a love as large as despair. Find an outside as vast as the inside. Curiosity is the answer. The way out of a mind is through the world."  
_Matt Haig_

September 2021. Over nine months, I encountered something totally new and intimidating over and over again. To be exact, Monday to Friday after work and almost every weekend.

Learning something very new and in-depth quickly every day left me quite tired. I didn't have time to worry because I was just chasing the whole time. I didn't heroically overcome the fear and gained new confidence.

The biggest thing I took away was this: when I didn't fully understand a topic, I was just pushed along to keep going and onto the next. That was really uncomfortable. But somehow when I returned back to it, it made so much more sense than before. I could even describe that I understand it now. Learning adjacent things actually helped me gain the necessary context to fully grasp what I didn't before.

So maybe when you think you're not going to make it, just keep going because the only way out is through.
