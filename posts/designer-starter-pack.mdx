# Designer Starter Pack

Designer Starter Pack is an interactive Figma skill map to keep track of resources and progress, that reflect industry expectations for beginner
and intermediate learners. I curated a list of useful skills for working
with Figma, with recommended resources. It's currently limited at this
definitive list of skills.

      <AccordionContainer title={"How did I choose the skills?"}>
        As a product designer at a lean product startup, I have been bringing my
        non-designer colleagues closer to the product development process via
        Figma. Simply teaching people how to navigate a page or prototype and
        add their comments benefits the entire team. Through my experiences
        developing and conducting Figma workshops for Friends of Figma
        Singapore, Tech For She, Padang.Co, and at Funding Societies, I've
        become more aware of how different beginners learn.

## How I built this?

- `v1.0.0`  
  Built using Node.js, Express.js and EJS after I learned about server-side web applications. Full set of CRUD routes, PostgresQL database queries were executed with raw SQL. Username and password login, session authentication.
  [See the code](https://github.com/samanthadotdesign/designerstarterpack)
- `v1.1.0`  
  I reorganized my app to follow the Model-View-Controller framework and using Sequelize ORM.
- `v2.0.0`  
  I rebuilt the project from scratch as a lightweight React app with custom Webpack configurations due to the frontend limitations of EJS. I also integrated p5.js canvases into the project.
  [See the code](https://github.com/samanthadotdesign/dsp)

## What did I learn?

<p className="lesson-header">1. If I ever needed to use EJS again</p>

In my first version, I used EJS. It looked okay but it was quite a hacky way to do things. It drove me crazy that every time I marked a skill as Complete Skill or Uncomplete Skill, EJS rerenders my whole page and the only way I could make it stay in place was using id for the section.

      <figcaption>Version Nº2 — More sophisticated form validation</figcaption>
    </div>

<p className="lesson-header">2. My first full CRUD app using MVC framework</p>

Nothing too interesting here except I realized I could send back responses as modified objects (different from raw data from database) to make it easier for myself.

Since the data and database not the same, I tried to make the code readable by keeping track of transform through comments.

<p className="lesson-header">3. Comparisons using SQL vs Sequelize mixins</p>

<p className="margin-top-36">
  Since I had many complex many-to-many SQL relationships, I learned how to
  harness the power of Sequelize ORM.
</p>

<p className="lesson-header">4. Learned how to customize Webpack settings</p>

It was kind of painful to customize the Webpack settings because it kept throwing me errors but I'm glad I finally got around to it in case I would need it in the future. Most importantly I learned what breadcrumbs to use when trying to troubleshoot the Webpack errors.

## What else would I do?

1. Although it is sized for mobile, there is a lot of room for improvement to manage users expectations while interacting with the resource modals.

</PostLayout>

<div className="container-fluid margin-top-36">
  <div className="row d-flex justify-content-around max-height-400">
    <div className="col-md-6">
      <LoopingVideoMobile src="/images/work/designer-starter-pack/ejs_mobile_modal.mp4" />
      <figcaption>
        Version Nº1 — Users can view resources and track skill.
      </figcaption>
    </div>
    <div className="col-md-6">
      <LoopingVideoMobile src="/images/work/designer-starter-pack/react_mobile_form.mp4" />
      <figcaption>
        Version Nº2 — Users can add their own resources. responsive site.
      </figcaption>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<PostLayout>

2. Currently users can only add resources. The ability to edit and delete the resources is necessary.

3. As the list of resources grows, adding favicons and emojis serves as helpful visual anchors and are also delightful.

4. Keeping Figma content up to date.

5. This project is not using the best of React like Context, React-router, etc.
