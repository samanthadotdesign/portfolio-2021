    Underwriting loans is the foundation of our business at Funding Societies.
    Our sales and credit teams use our internally-built loan origination system
    to continuously react and adjust our business model and risk underwriting.

<div className="col-md-4">
  <p className="lesson-header">Command Center</p>
  <p>
    Command Center allows all roles across the loan process to take mounds of
    data and transform them into easily-digestible, reliable decisions. When I
    joined in August 2019, the web service was in its infancy, as it was in the
    process of being overhauled with more power features. My goals were to
    oversee the design development of the entire platform suite, and to rebrand
    the product to distance it from its Excel roots.
  </p>

<div className="col-md-4">
  <p className="lesson-header">Design Lead, 2019–2021</p>
  <p>
    I had the unique opportunity to use in-progress and final prototypes to
    unite different teams to finalize the product requirements.
  </p>
  <p>
    As the sole designer for the Command Center, I was responsible for
    information architecture, UX, and visual design for all parts of the
    product. I was proud of our output and the significantly improved
    collaboration between different functions at the company while I was on the
    team. Building tools that help people do their jobs is one of the most
    satisfying types of work I’ve had the pleasure to take on.

      Behind our biggest revamp
    </p>

1. This was an all-or-nothing endeavour. All roles in the sales and credit organization needed to have all the information, in order for any single part to be useful.

2. Each loan has different risk assessment practices, which meant sales and credit roles with varying visibility for compliance. The plan was to build step-by-step, tackling one loan product at a time.

3. Our platform relied on many third-party integrations for functionalities that we could not develop ourselves, such as workflow management and pulling credit bureau data. There were constraints to the user flows related to calling these APIs.

4. The basic need to store and process customer data into a central system was difficult in itself. There wasn’t a single source of truth for all loan-related matters.

## Module Configuration

Our goal for the Command Center is to keep the user very focused and make sure they have all the right information at their fingertips in order to complete the task. The business operations decided to separate the loan processing into smaller, well-defined tasks.

This accomplishes a few things:

- allows us as an organization to track TAT for each task, which will help the business identify bottlenecks and optimize the operations
- the modular nature of the tasks allows business to make repeatable tasks for other types of loans
- allows our data to be analyzed by the system on one task at a time – brings the company a little bit closer to the goal of smart loan origination system that improves itself over time

      <p className="lesson-header">Contextual Inquiry</p>
      <p>
        I conducted contextual inquiry interviews to deeply understand the
        current origination and underwriting process, especially to capture
        missing nuances. 
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the challenges that emerged from this decision was users were
        used to seeing all the information at any given time. Everything was
        available to view at the same time albeit with different windows open:
        Slack, Excel, Google Sheets, Trello.
      </p>
      <p>
        We want our users to feel completing each defined task was seamless,
        that they weren’t sacrificing any of the information they were once used
        to.

      <p>
        I took users’ feedback and the research findings to significantly
        simplify the structure of the different workflow chunks. It sacrifices
        some parts of the earlier information in exchange for clearer hierarchy
        and eliminated one full-view multi-module presentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the first iteration, the module was a complex blend of hierarchy that
        mimicked Google Sheets. However, in practice the complexity led to
        confusion about which information belonged to which person, scrolling to
        different parts of the screen performed worse than when the users could
        see everything in one glance, because the whole thing took up of a
        vertical real estate. When you wanted to see everything, you end up
        having to have disconnected pieces that may not be useful most of the
        time.

        I made an exhaustive list of configurations for our task elements to do
        all kinds of work on the Command Center. We wanted to maintain
        consistent behaviour and covered the dozens of edge cases. The final
        arrangement establishes a logical, consistent eye-flow for users and
        groups tsk elements by their relationships to each other. It was
        important that the task was given a clear sense of “place” for users
        inside of the massive sea of mixed content.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also worked on systems to expand on previously built work to allow for
        more opportunities for new kinds of tasks to be implemented – allowing
        the Command Center to carry through the entire lifecycle of loan
        processing.

      <p>
        Because screen real estate is at a premium in advanced software, it was
        important that we defend our choice to add more whitespace to the UI.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s a lot of work to keep something simple and we weren’t chasing
        simplicity in the abstract. At the feature level, we have to constantly
        negotiate to make sure that we don't end up with this awkward clutter of
        all things, but are instead fairly opinionated in translating how the
        business is making the loan process more modular.
      </p>
      <p>
        Competitive analysis like this contextualized our decisions and reminded
        everyone that just because a UI change feels drastic internally, when
        compared to the broader software landscape it might be completely within
        the norm.

## Customizing Angular Libraries

I learned to accept that edge cases for some interactions should be handled by the best libraries. The fact is, I’m the only designer on the team with a very lean team of developers. I can spend a lot of time designing pagination, but it’s much more robust for the developers to use an existing library. Their time is best suited not working on such small elements.

This began my close collaboration with developers, where I would experiment to see how we can modify the styles to fit our design system, instead of designing and then handing it off the engineers. Below are a few interaction design patterns where we included my suggestions from researching and styling Angular libraries.

        teams process repeat customers, the searchbar is included in multiple

    <div className="col-md-4 padding-right-24">
      <p className="lesson-header">Hover over table headers and rows</p>
      <p>
        There are some parts which are built from scratch on top of the current
        library. For table headers and rows, users can take actions on them.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this example, our front-end engineer, Shubhro Bhownik created custom
        header component for the hover-arrow effect. The library that we are
        using cannot be used because it has server-side sorting.
      </p>
      <p>
        The custom header makes backend calls, based on whether the user has
        clicked up or down arrows, it sends DESC/ASC parameter to the backend.
        And when you click the arrow, it becomes highlighted as active so it
        stays on the header.

## The table as a big form

I designed many tables for viewing and selecting data but I’ll talk about these where users fill data. I was basically recreating Excel (what users are used to) for our Command Center.

One of the challenges was creating a performant web experience that users were familiar with such as Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel. We had to deprioritized features like enabling calculations inside cells to focus on precise, automated parsing of PDF statements directly into the cells, which would save users more time.

## UI Facelift

As Funding Societies was moving into presenting itself as a financing company with a robust internal tool, I felt it was the right time to unify the product’s visual language with that of marketing and consumer product surfaces.

We included typography and colour proportions foundations from marketing and consumer products. It was a simple swap but it helped to unify our surfaces across the entire company. This was an internal tool that our Engineering team has built from scratch and it deserved to look like it was.

</PostLayout>

<div className="container-fluid margin-top-36">
  <div className="row d-flex">
    <div className="col-md-4 padding-right-24">
      <p className="lesson-header">
        Type choices for clear information hierarchy
      </p>
      <p>
        Command Center was a wash of the default Material Design Roboto:
        navigation, labels, tables, buttons, searchbar are all set in the same
        typeface, and often in a single weight.
      </p>
      <p>
        This consistency was detrimental for many situations, where the
        functionality of a string needs to be immediately obvious and users can
        expect to interact with it. Feedback like color or underlining wasn't
        always an option.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first change was to use Inter, which was highly legible and more
        versatile in application. This simple change made a dramatic impact in
        the presentation of information to be more refined. We used different
        type sizes and grayscale to add a clear layer of informational hierarchy
        within our UI that both simplified design decisions and served as a
        clear signal to users as to the utility of the text strings in the
        product.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because processing loans is a type-driven platform, changing any
        typeface is a herculean effort, and I worked hand-in-hand with our
        front-end developers, Stuart Hammar and Shubhro Bownik to ensure the
        change-over was smooth.

      <p className="lesson-header">Style Guide</p>
      <p>
        Material Design is immediately identifiable and strongly associated with
        Google. While we could have incorporated logos, color palettes, and
        other differentiating factors to support the brand identity, the
        platform will almost always be associated with Google under its strong
        Material Design guidelines.
      </p>
      <p>
        To overcome the limitations of branding while using Material Design, I
        worked with our front-end developers to craft a style guide for Command
        Center. It contains the library of common components used in the product
        and expands out to design principles for the design team to follow, as
        well as UX guidance on usage and implementation for every piece used in
        the product, from form elements to typography and entire screen
        configurations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The style guide was vital for both our developers and our designers,
        giving us a shared kit of parts to work from and ensures consistency
        within our designs. This reduced complexity in product development and
        set a consistent pattern of expected behaviors for users. This framework
        was eventually adopted by additional suites in the customer-facing
        enterprise solution line and used across multiple teams at the company
        today.

## Impact in Digits

The result of investing two years of work into our loan origination system rehaul is best described by our group CEO, Kelvin Teo: we "have proven our AI-led credit capabilities in an unprecedented financial crisis".

In Q4 2021, Funding Societies annualised loan origination that exceeded US$1
billion. The overall platform default rate remained under 2% through the
pandemic.

We were able to improve the turnaround time for credit teams for accepting or declining loan cases by 30%. By capturing the end-to-end loan processing in one single system, 100% of TAT is recorded on the Command Center.

“Funding Societies is establishing a bridge for these companies to access more sustainable and cheaper financing by building unique data sets on their performance and using AI-led technology to assess their creditworthiness more effectively than traditional models.”
– Greg Moon, managing partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers.
