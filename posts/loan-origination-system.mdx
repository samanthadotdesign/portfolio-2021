# Smarter, Faster Loans

    Underwriting loans is the foundation of our business at Funding Societies.
    Our sales and credit teams use our internally-built loan origination system
    to continuously react and adjust our risk underwriting and loan book.
  </p>
</div>

<div className="col-md-4 px-md-4">
  <p className="lesson-header">Command Center</p>
  <p>
    Command Center allows all roles across the loan process to take large
    quantities of data and transform them into an easily-digestible form to make
    reliable decisions. When I joined in August 2019, the web service was in its
    infancy, as it was in the process of being overhauled with more powerful
    features. My role was to oversee the design development of the entire
    platform suite, and to rebrand the product to distance it from its
    Excel-based roots.

    I was responsible for coordinating across different teams to establish a
    final product based on my prototypes.
  </p>
  <p>
    As the sole designer for the Command Center, I was responsible for
    information architecture, UX, and visual design for all parts of the
    product. I was proud of my output and the significant impact it had on
    collaboration among different functions at the company. Building tools that
    help people do their jobs is one of the most satisfying types of work I’ve
    had the pleasure to take on.

      Behind our biggest revamp
    </p>

1. This was an all-or-nothing endeavour. Necessary loan information needed to be available to all roles across the sales and credit organisations in order to underwrite loans.

2. Each loan has different risk assessment practices, which meant we needed to build loan files with different levels of visibility across sales and credit roles to fit with compliance requirements. The plan was to build step-by-step, tackling one loan product at a time.

3. Our platform relied on many third-party integrations for functionalities that we did not develop ourselves, such as workflow management and pulling credit bureau data. There were constraints to the user flows related to calling these APIs.

4. The need to store and process customer data into a central system was difficult in itself. Previously, there wasn’t a single source of truth for all loan-related matters.

## Module Configuration

Our goal for the Command Center was to keep the user very focused and ensure they have the right information at their fingertips in order to complete the task. We decided to separate the loan underwriting processing into smaller, well-defined tasks.

This accomplishes a few things:

- allowed the organization to track TAT for each task, which will help the business identify bottlenecks and optimize the operations
- the modular nature of the tasks allows the business to make repeatable tasks for other types of loans
- allowed the business to systematically analyse historical data based on specific tasks and work towards building a self-improving smart loan origination system

      <p className="lesson-header">Contextual Inquiry</p>
      <p>
        My colleague and I conducted contextual inquiry interviews with 20
        users across different roles to deeply understand the current
        origination and underwriting process. It was especially important to
        capture nuances of the process that was not evident in the written
        output. 
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the challenges that emerged was that users wanted to see all
        information available at any given time. The existing process had
        everything available to view at the same time across different windows
        of Slack, Excel, Google Sheets, and Trello.
      </p>
      <p>
        We wanted our users to feel completing each defined task was seamless,
        that they weren’t sacrificing any of the information they were once used
        to.

      <p className="lesson-header">Configuration Exploration</p>
      <p>
        Based on users’ feedback and the research output, I was able to significantly simplify the structure of the different workflow components. It sacrificed visibility on some information in exchange for clearer hierarchy and eliminated the full-view multi-module presentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the first iteration, the module was a complex blend of hierarchical structures that
        mimicked Google Sheets. However, in practice the complexity led to
        confusion about which information belonged to which person. Having users scroll to
        different parts of the screen performed worse than having users view everything in one glance, because the whole task took up too much vertical real estate. When users wanted to see everything, they end up
        having disconnected pieces that may not be useful all the
        time.

        I made an exhaustive list of configurations for our task elements to do
        different tasks on the Command Center. We wanted to maintain consistent

        establishes a logical, consistent eye-flow for users and groups task
        elements by their relationships to each other.

        I also worked on a modular system that could accommodate new types of

<p className="lesson-header">Task Real Estate</p>

Because screen real estate is at a premium in software, it was important that we defend our choice to add more whitespace to the UI.

It takes effort to keep something simple and we were not chasing simplicity in the abstract. At the feature level, we had to constantly negotiate to avoid ending up with awkward clutter of all things, but are instead fairly opinionated in translating how the business is making the loan process more modular.

Competitive analysis helped to contextualize our decisions and reminded everyone that just because a UI change feels drastic internally, when compared to the broader software landscape it might be completely within the norm.

## Customizing Angular Libraries

I learned to accept that edge cases for some interactions should be handled by the best libraries. The fact is, I’m the only designer on the team with a very lean team of developers. I can spend a lot of time designing pagination, but it’s much more robust for the developers to use an existing library. Their time is best suited not working on such small elements.

This began my close collaboration with developers, where I would experiment to see how we can modify the styles to fit our design system, instead of designing and then handing it off the engineers. Below are a few interaction design patterns where we included my suggestions from researching and styling Angular libraries.

</PostLayout>

<p className="lesson-header">Advanced Search</p>

Our database of borrowers and their loans is our source of truth. As teams process repeat customers, the searchbar is included in multiple parts of the Command Center.

      <LoopingVideo src="/images/work/loan-origination-system/autocomplete-search.mp4" />
      <figcaption>
        One of my suggestions was to use autocomplete, predictive search to
        provide instant results.
      </figcaption>
    </div>
    <div className="col-md-7 pt-md-0 ps-md-4 pt-sm-5 ">
      <LoopingVideo src="/images/work/loan-origination-system/search-modal.mp4" />
      <figcaption>
        With the constraints of fetching from the database, I designed the
        search interaction to take place inside a modal instead.
      </figcaption>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<PostLayout>
  <p className="lesson-header">Multiselect Dropdown</p>
  <p>
    In this instance where users have to select multiple borrowers who are
    associated with one file, I experimented with angular multiselect dropdown
    libraries. Both{" "}
    <a href="https://github.com/CuppaLabs/angular2-multiselect-dropdown">
      angular2-multiselect-dropdown
    </a>{" "}
    has rich features to handle grouping, filter, and lazy load remote data.

    <div className="col-md-5 padding-right-24">
      <p className="lesson-header">Hover over table headers and rows</p>
      <p>
        There are some parts which are built from scratch on top of the current
        library. In this example, our front-end engineer, Shubhro Bhownik
        created custom header component for the hover-arrow effect. The library
        that we are using cannot be used because it has server-side sorting.
      </p>
      <p>
        The custom header makes backend calls, based on whether the user has
        clicked up or down arrows, it sends DESC/ASC parameter to the backend.
        And when you click the arrow, it becomes highlighted as active so it
        stays on the header.

## The table as a big form

I designed many tables for viewing and selecting data but I’ll talk about these where users fill data. I was basically recreating Excel (what users are used to) for our Command Center.

One of the challenges was creating a performant web experience that users were familiar with such as Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel. We had to deprioritize features like enabling calculations inside cells to focus on precise, automated parsing of PDF statements directly into the cells, which would save users more time.

    <LoopingVideo src="/images/work/loan-origination-system/table-form.mp4" />
    <figcaption>
      For some tasks where there used to be manual data entry for financial
      statements, we parse the values into the tables if possible.

## UI Facelift

As Funding Societies was moving into presenting itself as a financing company with a robust internal tool, I felt it was the right time to unify the product’s visual language with that of marketing and consumer product surfaces.

We included typography and colour proportions foundations from marketing and consumer products. It was a simple swap but it helped to unify our surfaces across the entire company. This was an internal tool that our Engineering team has built from scratch and it deserved to look like it was.

</PostLayout>

<div className="container-fluid margin-top-36">
  <div className="row d-flex">
    <div className="col-md-4 padding-right-24">
      <p className="lesson-header">
        Type choices for clear information hierarchy
      </p>
      <p>
        Command Center was a wash of the default Material Design Roboto:
        navigation, labels, tables, buttons, searchbar are all set in the same
        typeface, and often in a single weight.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first change was to use Inter, which was highly legible and more
        versatile in application. This simple change made a dramatic impact in
        the presentation of information to be more refined. We used different
        type sizes and grayscale to add a clear layer of informational hierarchy
        within our UI that both simplified design decisions and served as a
        clear signal to users as to the utility of the text strings in the
        product.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because processing loans is a type-driven platform, changing any
        typeface is a herculean effort, and I worked hand-in-hand with our
        front-end developers, Stuart Hammar and Shubhro Bownik to ensure the
        change-over was smooth.

      <p>
        I worked with our front-end developers to craft a style guide for
        Command Center. The Pantry Design System contains the library of common
        components used in the product and expands out to design principles for
        the design team to follow, as well as UX guidance on usage and
        implementation for every piece used in the product, from form elements
        to typography and entire screen configurations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The style guide was vital for both our developers and our designers,
        giving us a shared kit of parts to work from and ensures consistency
        within our designs. This reduced complexity in product development and
        set a consistent pattern of expected behaviors for users. This framework
        was eventually adopted by additional suites in the customer-facing
        enterprise solution line and used across multiple teams at the company
        today.

## Impact in Digits

The result of investing two years of work into our loan origination system rehaul is best described by our group CEO, Kelvin Teo: we "have proven our AI-led credit capabilities in an unprecedented financial crisis".

In Q4 2021, Funding Societies annualised loan origination that exceeded US$1
billion. The overall platform default rate remained under 2% through the
pandemic.

We were able to improve the turnaround time for credit teams for accepting or declining loan cases by 30%. By capturing the end-to-end loan processing in one single system, 100% of TAT is recorded on the Command Center.

“Funding Societies is establishing a bridge for these companies to access more sustainable and cheaper financing by building unique data sets on their performance and using AI-led technology to assess their creditworthiness more effectively than traditional models.”<br/>– Greg Moon, managing partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers.
